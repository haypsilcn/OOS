# Object Oriented Software
My internship assignments for module Object Oriented Software in FH Aachen WS2021.

The example used in the OOS internship is intended to represent a greatly simplified context of a bank (handling accounts, deposits and withdrawals and transfers). For this purpose, the functionality is gradually expanded in each internship attempt.
